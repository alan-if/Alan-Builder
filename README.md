# Introduction

The __Alan Builder__ tool will scan your project for all Alan adventures, compile them and run them against their associated commands scripts to generate game transcripts files, and provide a detailed report (viewable on GitHub commits) of all the operations carried out and the problems encountered, including letter-casing inconsistency in files extensions.

This tool was designed with big Alan projects in mind, for validating a large collection of source adventures and commands scripts scattered across multiple folders â€” e.g. library projects with a test suite, or large examples collections. But it can be used with projects of any size, including single-adventure projects.

The benefits of adding the __Alan Builder__ to an Alan IF project are manifold:

- It's designed to work with [Travis CI], allowing to validate GitHub commits and pull requests via continuous integration.
- It offers end users an easy way to build and update the project locally.
- It allows collaborators to test their contributed material locally, before submitting it to the project (via Git or otherwise).
- It enforces on any Alan project good standards, consistent naming conventions and best practices.
- It ensures that all adventures are compilable and runnable with a specific version of the [Alan SDK].
